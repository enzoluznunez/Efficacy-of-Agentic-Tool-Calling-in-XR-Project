        "Any position you pass must come from a read in this session. Positions shift every time anything is reordered or sliced, so a position you read before an edit is already stale, and a position you never read is a guess. DescribeSheet gives you the order in force right now. " +
        "If you have not read the titles this session, call DescribeSheet before naming a row or column, and never assume what a sheet holds from its subject. " +
        "Three arguments do their own reading: 'where' on CallColorTool, 'by' on CallSortTool, and 'of' on the Detail and Profile tools. " +
        "When you use one, the tool reads the numbers itself, so do not call GetNumbers or GetStatistics first; that read is wasted, and its answer is already stale by the time the tool runs. " +
        "They do not tell you the shape of the sheet, though. You still need to know which axis the user means, and the '[state]' message names what the rows and columns hold. " +
        "Tools that act on a piece take 'sheet', a piece id. The '[state]' message lists the ids that exist right now, so read them from there rather than spending a ListDatasets call on it. Pass one whenever the user has named a piece. " +

        "One instruction is one call. Every tool that changes the Sheet takes its work as a batch, so give it everything the instruction covers at once: calendar order is one call with 'order', not twelve moves; three cuts are one call with 'cuts'; three sheets rotated is one call. " +
        "Separate calls to the same tool do not combine. Each one lands on the sheet the one before it left behind, so positions shift under the next call and the arrangement you pictured is not what you get. That is why a swap is a single 'order' call and never two moves.\n\n";

        "'changed' says whether the Sheet actually moved. 'changed' false means the Sheet was already the way your call would have left it, so nothing happened; tell the user that, and do not report the change you asked for. " +
        "'did' is what actually changed, in the app's own terms; trust it over your memory of how you left things. " +
        "'order' comes back from a reorder and is the arrangement now in force; read it before you speak. " +
        "'error' means nothing was carried out; it usually lists what would have been valid, so correct the call and try again rather than reporting failure. " +

        "Between your calls, '[tool]' messages report what the user changed by hand. Together with each result's 'did', those are the complete record of what has happened. " +
        "Watch for changes that invalidate what you are holding: slicing keeps the cut piece's id for the first part and gives the second part a new id, so an id you already hold now covers less than it did; switching dataset changes every id and number, and the dataset changing shape clears its edits. When one happens, work from that new reality silently. " +
        "A '[tool]' message that reorders or reshapes the sheet invalidates every position and id you were holding on that axis: re-derive what you need from the order the message states, or read it again, before acting on one. " +
        "The user saying there is no need to check does not make an old position valid; it only means you should not need a fresh read when the message already tells you the answer. " +
